        The immune system - A different point of view
      </h1>
      <p className="mt-3 text-gray-600 w-300">
        What is the sole purpose of the immune system? To defend your body
        against viruses and bacterias that make you sick or in some cases kill
        you. It is your biological safe guardian. It consists of a network of
        biological systems (Immune system - Wikipedia). All it wants is to keep
        you alive and healthy. Like all complex systems it can work suboptimal.
        The main idea today in conventional medicine is that the immune system
        is broken and it can only be fixed by certain medicines. How can it be
        broken when all it does is try to help you? Research has shown that
        certain foods can trigger an immune response (källa). Is your immune
        system really broken because you can’t tolerate a certain food when
        another person can tolerate that? Who has decided that if you can’t
        tolerate a certain food then you are sick? Aren’t we all different and
        some people can tolerate foods that you can’t because we are different.
        Not because you are sick. I have faith in nature's ability to heal
        itself and my job is to give it the right conditions. Conditions such as
        what food we give our body, how we manage stress, our workout schedules,
        sleep patterns, spiritual rituals and so forth. Our input to the body
        decides how functional our immune system will be. But it is never
        broken. I guess I don’t like the idea of calling something as fantastic
        as the immune system, broken. If there is a God, do you think he didn’t
        have the skills to create a non-broken human? No, it is our job to
        create the right conditions for our body to thrive. Sure, we (humans)
        probably have different sensitivities, where some people tolerate more
        than others. But can it really be broken? Or is it the conditions that
        are broken? Finally I will end with an affirmation that I used in my
        healing journey: It is not my fault that I got sick but It is my
        responsibility to make me un-sick. Whatever it takes.
