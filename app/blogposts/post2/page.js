        Not treating the body as one unit is the biggest blunder in modern

        <span>Why do specialist doctors exist? </span>
        We have kidney experts, liver experts, gut experts and the list goes on.
        The kidney experts don’t communicate with the liver experts and so
        forth. Is there no possibility that if you have symptoms with your
        kidneys that the root cause can lie in the liver? This is an example to
        illustrate my point. Do we know that there is no possibility? Imagine
        you turn the key and your car doesn’t start. The dashboard lights
        flicker weakly, and it seems obvious that the battery is dead. When you
        replace the battery, the new one also drains after a few days. After
        some investigation, you discover the real root cause isn’t the battery
        at all , it’s a faulty alternator. The alternator’s job is to recharge
        the battery while the engine is running. Because it was malfunctioning,
        the battery wasn’t being recharged, so it kept dying. The symptom (a
        dead battery) and the root cause (a bad alternator) were in different
        parts of the system. We start to realize today, thanks to functional
        medicine, that the body consists of several organs that work together
        but isolating one organ and treating it as one independent part from the
        body is a mistake. This makes finding the root cause almost impossible.
        I have another example from my own experience. Two years ago I had
        severe back pain for three months. I was walking with a limp for these
        months. When it was over a tendon in my foot got torn. Prior to that I
        had a severe ulcerative colitis flare with high inflammation all over my
        body. Finally I got to the doctor because of my foot. He said it had
        nothing to do with my back pain and there is no reason to look anywhere
        else in the body but the foot. I don’t know why the tendon got torn but
        my theory is that the inflammation from the UC flare was the root cause
        for my back and the limp was the root cause for my tendon torn. I cannot
        prove that this is not the case but can I reject this theory only
        because I cannot prove it? How can we divide the body into different
        parts? Shouldn’t there just exist one type of doctor, one that is an
        expert on the whole body?
